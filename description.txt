The project consists of several modules:

1) Initializer (main) sets data and starts all necessary processes;

2) Parser - reads and parses data from file.

3) Address book – all city and country processes register in the address book when created; then all cities send queries to address book process asking for neighbours' PID. Handles all broadcast messages.

4) Countries – When created, it creates its own cities. Then country process handles messages from all its cities on every turn to know whether it's already complete or not. 

5) Cities – each city process sends necessary amounts of coins to all neighbouring cities, checks if it is complete and sends its state to its country process.

6) Control center – handles turns; after the beginning of a new turn sends messages to all cities; waits for everyone to send "turn done" messages; after that sends "new turn" message again. When all countries report completeness, broadcasts terminating message.
